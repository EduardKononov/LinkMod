# Link #
- Adds Link from The Legend of Zelda: Breath of the Wild as a playable character.
- Unlockable alternative skills and skins
- Multiplayer compatible

PM me on Discord @TheWarlock117#6226 with any bugs, complaints, or suggestions!

Please check known issues first!
Also be aware that I am unlikely to add any more skins than are already included. 
Due to the nature of BOTW's assets, adding new skins is incredibly time-consuming and tedious, and if I add any more, it will be further down the road, when I am feeling particularly masochistic.

## Known Issues
- Some animations are unsynced in Multiplayer - Bomb Throw, Paraglider, Shielding, etc.
- Mipha's Grace stock not correctly showing used for non-host players in Multiplayer - should be visual only
- Animation masking issues (Legs not moving while attacking, etc.) - Seems to be limited by BOTW's animations and model skeleton
- Some particles are unreasonably large (Teleporter particles, etc.). I believe this is caused by the model's initial scale, and as it takes an incredible amount of tedious work to get the model ready in-game, is likely not be patched anytime soon
- Some sounds don't play for non-host players in Multiplayer

## Future Plans
- Other Sheikah Slate abilities (Cryonis, Magnesis, Stasis) as alternate utilities

PM me on Discord @TheWarlock117#6226 with any bugs, complaints, or suggestions!

Please check known issues first!
Also be aware that I am unlikely to add any more skins than are already included. 
Due to the nature of BOTW's assets, adding new skins is incredibly time-consuming and tedious, and if I add any more, it will be further down the road, when I am feeling particularly masochistic.

- Stasis doesn't apply freeze effect properly when player has invulnerability (movement still stopped, but can still look around)

- Footstep sounds
- Jumping sounds
- Spawn sounds and animation
- Custom Mipha logic rather than just adding Dio's Best Friend

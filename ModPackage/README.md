## Known Issues
- Some animations are unsynced in Multiplayer - Bomb Throw, Paraglider, Shielding, etc.
- Mipha's Grace stock not correctly showing used in Multiplayer - should be visual only
- Hylian Outfit and Champion's Tunic skirts are ruffled. I believe this is caused by the way the skins had to be implemented, and is likely unavoidable without a breakthrough and massive overhaul.

## Future Plans
- Unlockables
- Other Sheikah Slate abilities as alternate utilities
